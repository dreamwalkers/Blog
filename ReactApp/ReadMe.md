## React App Boiler Plate App.
 ## Setup 
First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.
  If you don’t have Node.js installed, <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">install it from here</a>. You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later.
You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.
## Development server
Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to ` http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
